# Factfulness

The book starts with the assumption that readers would hold certain biases about the world; personally, I'd digress as someone who've heard from their parents on how the world has rapidly developed over the times. Kind of written for the Western point of view. 

However, it does do well in pointing out certain biases held by the population around the world, particularly in the well-off, level four countries around the world. 

It warns against these particular biases:

1. The Gap Instinct
    - Note things are not always polarised - look for the majority. 1) Beware comparisons of averages, as the spreads often overlap, 2) Beware comparisons of extremes, as the majority is often overlapping in the gap, and 3) Remember looking down from the top makes the gap seem similar.
2. The Negativity Instinct
    - Note negative news is more likely to reach us. 1) Distinguish between 'bad' and 'better', 2) Remember good news is not always reported, 3) Note gradual improvement is not reported, 4) Note more news is not always more suffering, but rather more surveillance, and 5) Beware of glorification of early experiences and histories.
3. The Straight Line Instinct
    - Note the inclination towards assuming straight lines and expect different rates and trends.
4. The Fear Instinct
    - Note that frightening things tend to grab our attention and calculate the risks instead. 1) Try to keep apart fear from reality, as fearful news is not often common, 2) Remember risk = danger x exposure, and 3) Try to stay calm before making decisions.
5. The Size Instinct
    - Don't be impressed by lonely numbers but try to get a comparison or proportion. 1) Compare with a different number, and try to divide per unit, 2) Look for the biggest items in with the 80/20 rule, and 3) Divide things at a rate per unit.
6. The Generalisation Instinct
    - Note when a category is being used as an explanation. 1) Look for differences within groups and across groups to see if your category is relevant and try to break down groups too large, 2) Look for differences across groups in order to see whether your explanation is really relevant, 3) Beware of what proportion is the 'majority'; 51% or 99%, 4) Beware of vivid, memorable examples, and 5) Assume people are not idiots and wonder why they think a certain way.
7. The Destiny Instinct
    - Note that things that seem constant often have slow changes, that might snowball into something significant. 1) Keep track of small improvements, 2) Update your knowledge quickly, and 3) Talk to predecessors to see the change that has happened, 4) Collect examples of cultural change.
8. The Single Perspective Instinct
    - Note that single perspectives can be limiting. 1) Test your ideas with other people, 2) Be humble about your limited expertise and that of others, 3) Try to look for people who look at things through different tools, and 4) Look at numbers, but not just numbers, and 5) Beware of simple ideas and solutions. Life is complex.
9. The Blame Instinct
    - Recognise when a scapegoat is being used. 1) Look for causes, not villains, and 2) Look for systems, not individual heroes.
10. The Urgency Instinct
    - Note that decisions are not always urgent and keep calm. 1) Take a breath before acting, 2) Insist on data to measure what is urgent, 3) Beware of those who predict the future, as predictions are always uncertain, and 4) Be wary of drastic actions, by thinking about the consequences. Generally, smaller steps are more effective.
