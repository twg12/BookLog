## 5. Kaplan on Demonstratives

1. Intension and Extension
* Extension: Truth-value of a given contingent sentence (reference)
* Intension: Meaning of the sentence (sense)
    * Kaplan employs it as a function from possible worlds to truth values
    * Definite descriptions (including rigid designators)

2. Indexicals
* Context0-dependent expressions: This, that, I, there, etc
* Must be analysed in different ways 
* The propositional conponent is constituted by the individual
    * Many senses cannot correspond to the same reference
    * Are rigid designators (!= direct reference)
* Two Principles of Indexicals
    * The reference of an indexical depends on the context of which it is uttered. 
    * Indexicals are directly referential (the proposition expressed by the indexical sentence is a singular proposition)

3. Context of Use and Conditions of Evaluation
* Context of Use: person, place, time   
    * "I exist" - must be true to have been uttered
    * `Character` interacts with context of use to determine reference
* Circumstance of evaluation: possible world where proposition is true or false
    * "I exist" - I may not exist in another world

4. Possible Worlds, Meaning, and Indexicals
* If context independent (held in another world), truth value may be false and intension different
* Thus, decriptions may be non-rigid
* Character + Context = Content
* Semantic Compositionality
    1. "I'm pregnant"
    2. "She's pregnant"
    * The character is different, but content same

5. "Today" and "Yesterday"
* Today and yesterday may refer to same day, but are not synonyms


## 6. Evans on Demonstratives

1. Fregean Theory of Indexicals
* Sense does not apply to indexicals? > Evans: the sense of an indexical is neither content nor character but rather the description a speaker has in mind when using an indexical

2. Point of Indexicality
* Mirror Examples: referring to yourself in the mirror before you understand it's yourself you're seeing
    * "I am the person reflected in the mirror" - who does 'I' refer to if I am the person reflected in the mirror?
* Amnesia: who am 'I' if I don't remember yourself and can refer to myself before learning about my past?
* Indexical sentence express a different kind of proposition from nonindexical sentences

3. Sense and Reference for Indexicals
* Relation between sense and reference: senses are ways we have of apprehending things, thus is something that presents the reference
* What is sense? It is given by stating the reference, but only some statements of reference succeed in giving the sense; we can specify sense of name by saying its reference, but with the right ascription of reference

4. Saying/Showing
* By showing, the viewer can gain knowledge without language: reference clauses say what the reference is and show what the sense is
    * We can only 'show' sense
    * Sense of expression is reference dependent
    * Names can have same reference and different senses

5. Mock Sense
* Frege does not believe there can be sense without reference
* Distinction between words with scientific sense and without

6. Empty Names
* If 'God' does not exist, what is the sense of that name?
* The empty name may have snese, but is contained within a synonymous definite description
* The empty name has a kind of mock or apparent sense
* It has no existent reference but has a Meinongian subsistent reference

7. Evan's views on Names
* If sense is a way of thinking about an object, there could not be a snese without the object existing
    * Hallucination?
    * In general, not true that way of seeing object only exists with object exists: depends on modes of presentation of objects
* `Descriptions` are not reference dependent, because there can be meaningful expressions without those descriptions existing
    * Mythical creatures

8. Today and Yesterday
* Two words are expressed in two different days: same sense although different character
    * Content is same on both days
* Truth-value exists on two sentences: if one is true, same for other
* BUT DIFFERENT
    * This is Frege's idea of sense

9. Character, Content, and Information
* Third layer is Information: acqured from from sense experience stored in memory
* Kaplan is right to introduce character and content, but those are not all that is required
* Evans believes only Fregean sense is needed - but is wrong in Today and Yesterday's sameness as character is different. He lacks elaboration on semantic difference


## Putname on Semantic Externalism

1. Background
* Indexical != definite description of the object or type of object referred to/uniquely identifying knowledge, ex) "I"
    * CONTEXT aka externalism
    * internalism is correct for descriptive reference
* How do words determine their reference?
    * It is not true that for any meaningful expression there is an intension that determines extension in every world
    * We understand terms through context, like indexicals
    * internal psychology does not determine reference

2. Twin Earth and "Water"
* Time before chemistry: people only know water
* On Twin earth, no water but only liquid similar to water with similar appearance but different chemicals
* Twin Earth might be duplicates of us, but refer to something different with word "Water" - same psychological state but different extensions (psych not determine reference or extension, but by context)
* Meanings differ 
* Meanings are not in the head (psych) - it is a social phenomenon, dependent on environment
    * There is an indexical element in natural kind terms

3. Criticisms of Putnam
* Is Putnam saying Meaning does not determine reference? "I" example
    * Character: meaning is not outside of head
* Putname assumes that pysch states are in head: people might have different psych states even if physically same
