## SBTC (Skill Based Technological Change) vs. Inequality
SBTC | Systematic Inequality
-|-
Just rewards from education and skills | Gains go to much smaller group
Meritocracy working well | New rising oligarchy
Need new human capital poicies | Wider problem

```
Myth that economic inequality is an inevitable, purely natural phenomenon
```
-> Politically consequential: shape responses to inequality  

## Can Economic Inequality conexist with Social/Political Equality?
* Ordinary Americans have complex views about the value of equality
``` 
"Political Power must be constrained against transmutation into economic power, and vice versa."
```
* Kevin Phillips, *Wealth and Democracy* : Parallels between "capital heydays" of the Gilded Age, the Roaring Twenties, and the contemporary era
    1. Major economic/corporate restructuring, bull markets and rising/dangerous levels of speculation/leverage/debt, exaltation of business/entrepreneurialism, the concentration of wealth, economic polarisation, and rising levels of inequality
    2. Conservative politics and ideology, skepticism of government, reduction or elimination of taxes (especially on corporations, personal income, or inheritance), and high levels of corruption
* The escalation of economic inequality is largely in part due to social/political factors
    * Economists fail to pay attention to these aspects 
* Economic Inequality != tax redistribution
    * Proof that majoritarian models to do not work

## 'Political' Economy
* Tendency to believe inequality is inevitable
    * Inequality is more about the longer-term shift in the structure of the economy
    * Discourages systematic critical scrutiny of causes and symptoms
    * Spreads belief inequality is unlikely to be mitigated by public policy
* Democrats have shown to promote better policies for inequality than Republicans
    -> They're also proven to risk inflation etc so..
* Statistics show that Democratic policies equalise income growth rates throughout percentiles
* Note pre-tax growth rates are shown to be more influenced than post-tax growth rates although this is attributed to the wider boundary of date 
    * Suggests contemporary efforts to change pre-tax income growth inequality has been less successful
```
Chapter 2: Illustrates how policy **can** mitigate economic inequality, despite the basic assumption that inequality is a natural consequence that cannot be helped. This is achieved by contrasting policies between the Democrats and Republicans.
```

## Class Politics and Partisan Change
Why do people vote Republican?
* They care about things other than income
    * 'Working-class, cultural conservatives'
    * Proved false: Republicans are more likely middle- and upper income voters
* Less Low-income whites are identifying as Republican
* There has been no significant conservative shifts since 1970

More Democrats?
* South has seen decrease in Democrats
    * This is due to the growing disparity among poor and affluent whites
    * Due to decreasing bipartisanship
* Democratic identification has *increased* among whites as a whole

Shift from Economic to Cultural issues
* Republicans have shifted issues from economic to cultural: Low income voters are generally economically liberal and culturally conservaitve
* Downplayal of politics of economics: culture > economics
* Statistics show biggest drivers are actually 'government spending and services'(economics) and defence
    * Why is defence so important for low-income earners?
* *Increase in cultural emphasis more prominent amongst high-income voters*
    * 여유의 문제? 경제적인 필요조건들이 충족되었음으로 사회적인 이슈 ㄱㄱ
```
The thought that Democrats do not do well among low-income white citizens is false, as is the thought that cultural issues take the front seat than economic issues. Low-income whites are increasingly voting Democrat. 
```

## Partisan Biases in Economic Accountability

* Reasons for Republican votes
    1. Myopic perspectives: responding to income growth but not actual output
    2. Income growth for affluent families more consequential
        * 1번과의 연관성?
    3. Balance of campaign spending

Myopic Voters
* Relationship between income growth and incumbent party's expected vote margin is stong
* Political manipulation of economic policy can encourage 'wasteful government spending' and 'economic instability and inefficiency around election time
    * Holds true of Republicans, but not Democrats
* Republicans have been successful in creating income growth during *election years*
    * Note power of *Recency Effect*?

Class Biases
* Americans are sensitive to the economic fortunes of high-income families, and not low-income/middle-income families
* GDP per Capita does not reflect on low-income families
* Low-income families more sensitive to higher-income growth level during election year

Campaign Spending
*  Mass media focuses on fortunes of affluent
* Campaign spending highly influences voter's choices
```
Voters' sensitivity to high-income growth bolsters the Republicans' average vote margine by 3.5%. In this way, contemporary American electoral politics is shaped by partisan biases in economic accountability. 
```

## Do Americans Care about Inequality?
* "The ideal of equality, despite its prominence in our official ideology, has little real resonance in American political culture"
    * People define political freedom as strict equality, but economic freedom as an equal chance to bcome unequal
Micro-justice (Individual rewards)| Macro-justice (social distribution of rewards)
Economic inequality -|- Political equality
Differentiation -|- Equality
* Chance from play of economic interests and powerful set of values associated with the private enterprise system that conflicts with 
egalitarianism
* Exceptions: wealthy must pay fair share of taxes, loopholes large, resentment towards wealthy
* 4 facets
    1. Public support for broad egalitarian values
    2. Public attitudes towards salient economic groups
    3. Public perceptions of economic inequality
    4. How public perceptions of inequality are shaped
