## SBTC (Skill Based Technological Change) vs. Inequality
SBTC | Systematic Inequality
-|-
Just rewards from education and skills | Gains go to much smaller group
Meritocracy working well | New rising oligarchy
Need new human capital poicies | Wider problem

```
Myth that economic inequality is an inevitable, purely natural phenomenon
```
-> Politically consequential: shape responses to inequality  

## Can Economic Inequality conexist with Social/Political Equality?
* Ordinary Americans have complex views about the value of equality
``` 
"Political Power must be constrained against transmutation into economic power, and vice versa."
```
* Kevin Phillips, *Wealth and Democracy* : Parallels between "capital heydays" of the Gilded Age, the Roaring Twenties, and the contemporary era
    1. Major economic/corporate restructuring, bull markets and rising/dangerous levels of speculation/leverage/debt, exaltation of business/entrepreneurialism, the concentration of wealth, economic polarisation, and rising levels of inequality
    2. Conservative politics and ideology, skepticism of government, reduction or elimination of taxes (especially on corporations, personal income, or inheritance), and high levels of corruption
* The escalation of economic inequality is largely in part due to social/political factors
    * Economists fail to pay attention to these aspects 
* Economic Inequality != tax redistribution
    * Proof that majoritarian models to do not work

## 'Political' Economy
* Tendency to believe inequality is inevitable
    * Inequality is more about the longer-term shift in the structure of the economy
    * Discourages systematic critical scrutiny of causes and symptoms
    * Spreads belief inequality is unlikely to be mitigated by public policy
* Democrats have shown to promote better policies for inequality than Republicans
    -> They're also proven to risk inflation etc so..
* Statistics show that Democratic policies equalise income growth rates throughout percentiles
* Note pre-tax growth rates are shown to be more influenced than post-tax growth rates although this is attributed to the wider boundary of date 
    * Suggests contemporary efforts to change pre-tax income growth inequality has been less successful
```
Chapter 2: Illustrates how policy **can** mitigate economic inequality, despite the basic assumption that inequality is a natural consequence that cannot be helped. This is achieved by contrasting policies between the Democrats and Republicans.
```

## Class Politics and Partisan Change
Why do people vote Republican?
* They care about things other than income
    * 'Working-class, cultural conservatives'
    * Proved false: Republicans are more likely middle- and upper income voters
* Less Low-income whites are identifying as Republican
* There has been no significant conservative shifts since 1970

More Democrats?
* South has seen decrease in Democrats
    * This is due to the growing disparity among poor and affluent whites
    * Due to decreasing bipartisanship
* Democratic identification has *increased* among whites as a whole

Shift from Economic to Cultural issues
* Republicans have shifted issues from economic to cultural: Low income voters are generally economically liberal and culturally conservaitve
* Downplayal of politics of economics: culture > economics
* Statistics show biggest drivers are actually 'government spending and services'(economics) and defence
    * Why is defence so important for low-income earners?
* *Increase in cultural emphasis more prominent amongst high-income voters*
    * 여유의 문제? 경제적인 필요조건들이 충족되었음으로 사회적인 이슈 ㄱㄱ
```
The thought that Democrats do not do well among low-income white citizens is false, as is the thought that cultural issues take the front seat than economic issues. Low-income whites are increasingly voting Democrat. 
```

## Partisan Biases in Economic Accountability

* Reasons for Republican votes
    1. Myopic perspectives: responding to income growth but not actual output
    2. Income growth for affluent families more consequential
        * 1번과의 연관성?
    3. Balance of campaign spending

Myopic Voters
* Relationship between income growth and incumbent party's expected vote margin is stong
* Political manipulation of economic policy can encourage 'wasteful government spending' and 'economic instability and inefficiency around election time
    * Holds true of Republicans, but not Democrats
* Republicans have been successful in creating income growth during *election years*
    * Note power of *Recency Effect*?

Class Biases
* Americans are sensitive to the economic fortunes of high-income families, and not low-income/middle-income families
* GDP per Capita does not reflect on low-income families
* Low-income families more sensitive to higher-income growth level during election year

Campaign Spending
*  Mass media focuses on fortunes of affluent
* Campaign spending highly influences voter's choices
```
Voters' sensitivity to high-income growth bolsters the Republicans' average vote margine by 3.5%. In this way, contemporary American electoral politics is shaped by partisan biases in economic accountability. 
```

## Do Americans Care about Inequality?
* "The ideal of equality, despite its prominence in our official ideology, has little real resonance in American political culture"
    * People define political freedom as strict equality, but economic freedom as an equal chance to bcome unequal
Micro-justice (Individual rewards)| Macro-justice (social distribution of rewards)
Economic inequality -|- Political equality
Differentiation -|- Equality
* Chance from play of economic interests and powerful set of values associated with the private enterprise system that conflicts with 
egalitarianism
* Exceptions: wealthy must pay fair share of taxes, loopholes large, resentment towards wealthy
* 4 facets
    1. Public support for broad egalitarian values
        * Americans believe in equal opportunity, but distinct thinking between equality of opportunity and equality of results
        * Political left more egalitarian, but generally independent to party identification and ideology
    2. Public attitudes towards salient economic groups
        * Most people likely to side with poor than rich, warmer to people on welfare than big businesses
        * Most agree with less tax for poor, more tax for rich
    3. Public perceptions of economic inequality
        * Many aware that inequality has been increasing
        * General trend of less tolerance for economic inequality
    4. How public perceptions of inequality are shaped
        * Ideological perspectives: conservatives less likely to be aware of inequality
        * Politically aware conservatives more likely to be unaware of inequality

## Homer Gets a Tax Cut
Despite Egalitarianism...
* Lack of opposition for upward transfer of wealth
* People failed to bring relevant values to bear in formulating policy preferences
    * People more likely to want government programs = more likely to support tax cuts
* Tax cuts based on *own* burden than of rich

Bush Tax Cuts (EGTRRA)
* Efforts for tax cutting help rich than poor
    * Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act
    * Job and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act
* Public in fact enjoys tax cuts
* Although voters are aware tax cuts will more likely support rich, they go for tax cuts
    * BUT they prefer certain government programs(medicare & social security) to tax cutsa
    * Response to survey may have been superficial, ignorant, and uncertain

Public Opinion
* More educated = less likely to support tax cuts
* Well-informed conservatives less likely to say tax cut was very important, while liberals vice versa
    * More well-informed, more opinionated
* Tax cut based on ideological difference: show of political ignorance
* Decreasing support for tax cuts, but still more supporters than opposition

## Estate Tax Repeal

Bush tax cuts repealed federal state tax
* Estate tax only to affect 2% of top income-earners, yet backlash
    * Estate tax highly unpopular before conservatives encouraged its repeal
    * Powerful public officials pursuing their own ideological impulses, ignorant or heedless of public sentiment

Why is estate tax popular?
* Lack of awareness?
    * Not about lack of political information
* Positive correlation between those who believed their own tax burden was to high and those who supported estate tax repeal
* Lack of factual or moral basis for thinking growing economic inequality might be problematic and worsened by estate tax repeal
* Political information limited as transformational force
    * Can bolster support for repeal among those that don't care about income inequality

``` 
Highlights the limited force of public sentiment when it happens to conflict with the ideological convictions of strategically placed political elites
```

## The Lowering Minimum Wage

Minimum wage
* Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007
    *  Increased Minimum Wage from $5.15 to $7.25
    * Actually isolated case in downward trend: real value of minimum wage still less than 50 years earlier
* Minimum wage actually driven more by partisanship and ideology than public opinion/economics
* Inflation: Nominal wage stays same, but real value decreased

Why is Minimum Wage Decreasing?
* Public opinion against decreasing minimum wage : even rich and the republicans believe minimum wage is too low
* Declining Labour Union
* Economic evidence is against negatives of decreasing minimum wage
    * Minimum wage has negative impact on employment : Card and Krueger
    * Rising inequality on bottom of income distribution
* Partisan poiltics
    * Antimajoritarian features of American legislative process
    * Republicans refuse to pass policies suggested by Democrats
    * Democrats refuse to lower standards that are suggested by Republicans
* Inflation : Inaction has caused the decline of its real value
    * Intitutional checks and balances make it difficult for a simple majority to make policy change

```
Account for substantial increase in real value of minimum wage in first two decades of the post-war era and for its subsequent decline after:
 > Despite widespread support for higher minimum wage, partisan politics in democratic process has prevented minimum wage from rising
```

## Economic Inequality and Political Representation 

Politics and Economy
* Lack of knowledge between changing economic inequality and changes in political behavior, institutions, public policy
* Well documented: political participation between rich and poor
    * Important for representation
* Representation by US senators: those who were rich has more political weight

Ideological Representation
* Assumption: elected officials are equally responsive to the views of all their constituents
* Truth: Both parties, Democrat and Republican are sensitive to the opinions of resource-rich constituents
* Why?
    * Poor don't vote? (x)
    * Less knowledgeable about politics, less likely to monitor representative's behavior? Not as much. 
    * Less contact with representative: each contact with senator or staff increased weight attached to contacting constituent's views.
    * **Contact more important than political knowledge or turnout**
        * 인과관계의 의문: 연락할 수 있는 권력의 사람들은 영향력이 애초부터 있는 사람들이 아닌가
    * Data consistent with suggestion representation is focused on those with campaign contribution
* Plausible that public opinion may only seem influential because it correlates with the opinion of influential elites, organised interest groups, or policy makers themselves
* Still, poor can have indirect impact through public opinion in electoral process.
    * Yet, the affluent have significant direct *and* indirect effects on behavior of elected officials. 


``` 
Senators pay no atention to constituents in the bottom third of income distribution, due to perhaps:

1. Poor have less contact with representative: possibility, but only part of the issue
2. Poor contribute less to campaigning fees and lobbying, although this is an indirect reason
```

## Unequal Democracy

Political Power
* If possession of political power is due to economic power or wealth, it is an oligarchy
* If unpropertied class has power, that is democracy
* Public opinion distrusts economic elites
* Can economic and political spheres of justice be kept seperate?

Effects of Economic Inequality
* Affluent people have political clout
    * The lower third are completely silenced in policy making process
* Is it true democracy if politicans make policies irrelevant to public opinion?

Positive Hopes
* There are people who support egalitarian policies despite class interests

Why do people not pursue their own interests in democracy?
* They might be confused about their interests (estate tax)
    * Not necessarily true: Republican party's 'cultural wedge' or 'hallucinary appeal' is unlikely
    * Misperceptions, myopa, missing connections between values/interests and policy preferences/votes
* Ideological Background
    * Partisan differences in attributions of responsibility for national economic conditions
* Political Awareness
    * In case of Republicans, the case might be exacerbated
* Social isolation of rich and poor (economic segregation)
